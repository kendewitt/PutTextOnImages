# PutTextOnImages

PutTextOnImages is a little script that takes two lines of text copied to the clipboard and pastes it over an image. I originally wrote this for an old blog I was doing called "Cool English". It saved me some time creating Wordpress featured images, as I didn't have to retype the post title and overlay it on an image in an image editor. Instead, I just wrote the post, copied the English and Japanese titles to the clipboard, and then ran this script from the Mac services menu.
